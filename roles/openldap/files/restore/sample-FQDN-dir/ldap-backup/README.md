# LDAP Backup & Restore

Put into this directory the following openLDAP backup file to be able to perform a restoration of directory service:

  - ```ldap-users.ldif.gz```

    (The ```ldap-users.ldif.gz``` file is generated by```/etc/cron.daily/ldap-backup``` script hosted on each IdP by default.
    By default will be maintained 30 backups and stored into ```/var/local/backups/ldap/```.)

and then set the ```ldap_restore``` variable to "True" on the IdP configuration ```host_vars``` file.
